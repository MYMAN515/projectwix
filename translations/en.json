    "response": {
      "puberty": "Great question! Starting conversations about puberty early and keeping them ongoing is key. Use natural opportunities like seeing related content on TV or books. Keep the tone casual and normalize the topic. Let your child know they can always come to you with questions, and reassure them that all the changes they're experiencing are completely normal.",
      "emotions": "Emotional support during puberty is crucial. Validate your child's feelings - mood swings are normal due to hormonal changes. Listen without judgment, give them space when needed, but also let them know you're always available. Help them identify and name their emotions, and teach healthy coping strategies like exercise, journaling, or talking with trusted friends.",
      "communication": "Effective communication builds trust. Practice active listening - put away distractions and give your full attention. Ask open-ended questions rather than yes/no questions. Share your own experiences (age-appropriately) to show you understand. Most importantly, create a judgment-free zone where they feel safe sharing anything.",
      "social": "Social dynamics change during puberty. Help your child navigate friendships by discussing what healthy relationships look like. Talk about peer pressure and give them language to set boundaries. Encourage diverse friendships and validate their feelings when friendships shift or end - it's a normal part of growing up.",
      "privacy": "This app prioritizes privacy completely. All diary entries and data stay on your device - nothing is sent to servers. The diary is a private space for your child. We don't track users or collect personal information. Your family's privacy and your child's safety are our top priorities.",
      "activities": "The Games section offers interactive activities designed to teach about puberty in a fun, engaging way. These include memory games, emotion recognition exercises, and matching activities. These games help normalize conversations about puberty and make learning enjoyable rather than awkward.",
      "default": "I'm here to help you with any parenting questions about puberty! You can ask me about: communication strategies, understanding physical/emotional changes, handling difficult situations, supporting your child's mental health, navigating social challenges, and much more. What would you like to know?",
      "hygiene": "Puberty can cause new body odours and skin changes. Create a simple routine: daily showers, clean clothes, and deodorant if they are comfortable. Show them how to care for their skin gently and keep supplies accessible so it feels normal, not embarrassing.",
      "sleep": "Sleep can get tricky during puberty. Keep a consistent bedtime, reduce screens at least an hour before, and invite them to try calming routines such as journaling or deep breathing. Remind them that tiredness can magnify emotions, so rest is part of self-care.",
      "support": "I'm cheering you on! You're already doing a lot by looking for guidance. Reach out to your child regularly with small check-ins, and lean on the Parent Guide, Guidance hub, and our MG team whenever you need reassurance.",
