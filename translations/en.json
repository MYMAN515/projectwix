      "puberty": "Great question! Try these steps:\n• Choose relaxed everyday moments—car rides, walks, shared chores—to mention changes you've noticed.\n• Share small facts often instead of one big \"talk\" so information feels normal.\n• Invite questions by saying, \"You can ask me anything, even if it feels awkward.\"\n• Keep trusted books or articles handy so your child can explore privately and return when they're ready.\n• Reassure them every body grows at its own pace and you are beside them all the way.",
      "emotions": "Emotional waves are part of puberty. Try this:\n• Validate feelings first (\"I can see this feels really tough\").\n• Create a calming toolkit together—breathing, stretching, drawing, favourite songs.\n• Encourage them to name emotions and rate how strong they feel.\n• End the day with a short \"feelings check\" so they know big emotions are welcome at home.\n• If emotions feel overwhelming for both of you, pause the chat and revisit when everyone is calmer.",
      "communication": "Strong communication grows through routine.\n• Schedule weekly check-ins and let your child choose the activity.\n• Use openers like, \"What was a win and a wobble today?\"\n• Reflect back what you hear and thank them for sharing.\n• If conversations heat up, agree to pause, breathe, and continue later—respect is more important than winning.\n• Share your own feelings occasionally so they know it's safe to be honest.",
      "social": "Friendships can feel stormy right now.\n• Discuss what healthy friendship behaviours look like—kind words, listening, respecting boundaries.\n• Role-play how to respond to peer pressure so they feel ready.\n• Encourage clubs or teams that match their interests to widen their circle.\n• Remind them that changing friendships are normal and never reflect their worth.\n• Celebrate acts of kindness they show to others to build confidence.",
      "privacy": "We built this app with family privacy at heart.\n• Diary entries stay on this device—no personal data leaves your home.\n• There are no trackers or ads hidden anywhere.\n• Encourage your child to use the diary as a private space to process feelings.\n• Set shared agreements about when, if ever, you'll review entries together.\n• Revisit privacy promises regularly so trust stays strong.",
      "activities": "Learning sticks when it's playful.\n• Explore the Games section together and talk about what you both notice.\n• Memory matches build body knowledge, quizzes boost confidence, and emotion games open honest chats.\n• Ask which activity felt most helpful and why.\n• Use their answer as a bridge to keep the conversation going offline.\n• Celebrate participation—not perfection—to keep things fun.",
      "hygiene": "Help your child build a simple hygiene rhythm.\n• Shower daily or after sports, use deodorant, and change into clean clothes.\n• Care for skin and hair with products that match their needs.\n• Turn it into teamwork: create a checklist and stick it in the bathroom.\n• Practice together the first few times, then cheer on their independence.\n• Praise effort rather than perfection so confidence can grow.",
      "nutrition": "Bodies need steady fuel right now.\n• Offer balanced meals—colourful fruits and veggies, proteins, whole grains, and plenty of water.\n• Invite your child to plan or cook one meal a week.\n• Keep quick, healthy snacks ready for sudden hunger.\n• Talk about listening to hunger and fullness cues.\n• Share how nourishing foods keep energy and mood steady during growth spurts.",
      "sleep": "Hormonal shifts can delay sleepiness.\n• Dim lights an hour before bed and switch to calming activities.\n• Keep wake-up times steady, even on weekends.\n• Offer quiet bonding moments—stretching, gentle chat, or reading together.\n• If worries keep them awake, jot them in a notebook to revisit tomorrow.\n• Model your own wind-down routine so they see rest as a priority.",
      "boundaries": "Talk openly about personal boundaries.\n• Cover body privacy, emotional space, and respecting others' limits.\n• Model asking for consent (\"Can I give you a hug?\").\n• Practise scripts for saying no kindly but firmly.\n• Celebrate when they speak up for themselves or for friends.\n• Remind them that clear boundaries build healthier, safer relationships.",
      "digital": "Create a family media plan together.\n• Agree on screen-free zones—mealtimes and bedrooms at night are great places to start.\n• Discuss how to handle friend requests, DMs, or surprising content.\n• Teach them to pause before posting and to talk to you if something feels wrong.\n• Promise they won't be in trouble for sharing unsafe online moments.\n• Review the plan regularly as their needs and maturity grow.",
      "menstruation": "Approach periods with calm confidence.\n• Explain the basics—cycle length varies, cramps are common, and supplies exist for every body.\n• Show how to track cycles on paper or in a trusted app.\n• Pack a small school kit with pads, liners, and spare underwear.\n• Discuss pain relief strategies—heat packs, stretching, doctor visits if needed.\n• Remind them periods are a healthy sign of growth, never something to hide.",
      "default": "I'm here to help with anything related to puberty, wellbeing, and family communication. Ask about hygiene routines, period support, emotional health, friendships, school stress, faith considerations, or keeping conversations flowing in multiple languages. Let's tackle it together—what's on your mind?"
