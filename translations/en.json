    "response": {
      "puberty": "Great question! Starting conversations about puberty early and keeping them ongoing is key. Use natural opportunities like seeing related content on TV or books. Keep the tone casual and normalize the topic. Let your child know they can always come to you with questions, and reassure them that all the changes they're experiencing are completely normal.",
      "emotions": "Emotional support during puberty is crucial. Validate your child's feelings - mood swings are normal due to hormonal changes. Listen without judgment, give them space when needed, but also let them know you're always available. Help them identify and name their emotions, and teach healthy coping strategies like exercise, journaling, or talking with trusted friends.",
      "communication": "Effective communication builds trust. Practice active listening - put away distractions and give your full attention. Ask open-ended questions rather than yes/no questions. Share your own experiences (age-appropriately) to show you understand. Most importantly, create a judgment-free zone where they feel safe sharing anything.",
      "social": "Social dynamics change during puberty. Help your child navigate friendships by discussing what healthy relationships look like. Talk about peer pressure and give them language to set boundaries. Encourage diverse friendships and validate their feelings when friendships shift or end - it's a normal part of growing up.",
      "privacy": "This app prioritizes privacy completely. All diary entries and data stay on your device - nothing is sent to servers. The diary is a private space for your child. We don't track users or collect personal information. Your family's privacy and your child's safety are our top priorities.",
      "activities": "The Games section offers interactive activities designed to teach about puberty in a fun, engaging way. These include memory games, emotion recognition exercises, and matching activities. These games help normalize conversations about puberty and make learning enjoyable rather than awkward.",
      "hygiene": "Daily hygiene routines give your child a sense of control. Build a checklist together: showering after active days, using deodorant, changing pads or liners regularly, and caring for skin. Celebrate when they remember steps on their own and gently remind them when needed.",
      "culture": "Honour your family's cultural and religious values while teaching. Share stories about how elders guided you, explain why certain practices matter, and invite questions. Emphasise respect and privacy so your child knows traditions and personal comfort can co-exist.",
      "default": "I'm here to help you with any parenting questions about puberty!
